# Episode 03 - Laying the Foundation

## Theory üìù
## 1) What is `JSX`?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods.
JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.

```
JSX => React.createElement => React Element => JS Object => HTML Element(render)
```
```
Using JSX 
const heading = <h1 className="heading">JSX Matter's</h1>
const root = ReactDOM.createElement(document.getElementById("root")
root.render(heading)
```
```
Without JSX
const heading = 
```
## 2) Superpowers of JSX.
Using JSX, you can write markup inside Javascript, providing you with a superpower to write logic and markup of a component inside a single .jsx file. JSX is easy to maintain and debug.

## 3) Role of `type` attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?
The `type` attribute specifies the type of the script. The type attribute identifies the content between the `<script>` and `</script>` tags. It has a Default value which is ‚Äútext/javascript‚Äù.
### `type` attribute can be of the following types:
- `text/javascript` : It is the basic standard of writing javascript code inside the `<script>` tag.
    ### Syntax
    ```
    <script type="text/javascript"></script>
    ```
- `text/ecmascript` : this value indicates that the script is following the `EcmaScript` standards.
- `module`: This value tells the browser that the script is a module that can import or export other files or modules inside it.
- `text/babel` : This value indicates that the script is a babel type and required bable to transpile it.
- `text/typescript`: As the name suggest the script is written in `TypeScript`.

## 4) `{TitleComponent}` vs `{<TitleComponent/>}` vs `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` in `JSX`.
A: The Difference is stated below:
- `{TitleComponent}`: This value describes the `TitleComponent` as a javascript expression or a variable. 
The `{}` can embed a javascript expression or a variable inside it.
- `<TitleComponent/>` : This value represents a Component that is basically returning Some JSX value. In simple terms `TitleComponent` a function that is returning a JSX value.
A component is written inside the `{<  />}` expression.
- `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` :  `<TitleComponent />` and `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` are equivalent only when `< TitleComponent />` has no child components. The opening and closing tags are created to include the child components.
